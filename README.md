# JustC Alpha
JustC is designed as a lightweight, beginner-friendly IDE and code editor, created as a modern successor to legacy tools like Quency 2005 and TurboC. Built in pure Java Swing, JustC aims to provide an easy and accessible environment for beginners to write and compile code, with features to streamline development from file management to code execution.

### Features
* **Easy Code Compilation**
JustC supports basic code compilation and features an embedded terminal (powered by JediTerm) for running compiled code seamlessly within the IDE.

* **Lightweight Design**
The IDE is designed to be simple and resource-efficient, making it suitable for beginners and those on systems with limited resources.

* **Syntax Highlighting & Code Structure**
JustC integrates RSyntaxTextArea for syntax highlighting and RSyntaxTree for basic code analysis (currently in alpha stage), ensuring clean code formatting and easy-to-read structures.

* **File Tree**
A built-in file explorer helps manage and organize project files directly within the IDE, allowing for easy navigation and code access.

* **Dark Mode Interface**
JustC uses the FlatMacDark theme for an elegant, dark-themed UI thatâ€™s easy on the eyes during long coding sessions.

## Technologies
* **Java Swing:** The main UI framework.
* **JediTerm:** For terminal emulation within the IDE.
* **RSyntaxTextArea:** For syntax highlighting.
* **RSyntaxTree:** For basic syntax analysis and structure display.
* **FlatLaf:** Specifically, the FlatMacDark theme for a sleek, modern interface.
